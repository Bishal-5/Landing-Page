        <p>Virat Kohli (born November 5, 1988, Delhi, India) is an Indian international cricketer considered by many as
            one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game. Kohli plays for (and previously captained) the Royal
            Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He is also a former captain of the Indian
            cricket team in all three international formats—Test cricket, one-day internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20
            internationals (T20I)—making him one of India’s most successful captains. <br>

            Kohli has earned praise for his discipline and commitment from teammates, opponents, and cricket veterans
            alike. “He has changed the face of cricket and how you prepare for the game. The discipline that he has
            stands out, always,” cricketing great Brian Lara said of Kohli after Kohli was named Player of the
            Tournament for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. <br></p>

        <p>Kohli holds several cricket records, including the most individual hundreds in ODI matches and the most runs
            scored in a single edition of an ODI World Cup. He has been named Player of the Tournament at global events
            on three occasions: at the 2014 and 2016 T20I World Cups and the 2023 ODI World Cup. Kohli was also a member
            of the Indian sides that won the 2011 ODI World Cup and the 2013 ICC (International Cricket Council)
            Champions Trophy. He is married to popular Bollywood actress and producer Anushka Sharma. <br> Kohli’s
            strong run of scores led to a long stint with the national team. He scored his first ODI hundred in 2009
            against Sri Lanka. A part of the Indian team at the 2011 ODI World Cup, Kohli scored a hundred in his World
            Cup debut against Bangladesh. He would go on to score a crucial 35 runs in the final as India won the World
            Cup for the first time in 28 years. <br></p>

        <p>Kohli debuted in Tests later in 2011 against the West Indies, as players such as Sachin Tendulkar were
            rested after the World Cup win. In the disastrous tour of Australia in 2011–12, India lost the Test series
            4–0, but Kohli scored the only century by an Indian player on the tour, earning praise. He was by now
            establishing himself as a master of the chase in ODIs. In the 2012 Commonwealth Bank Series tournament with
            Australia and Sri Lanka, India needed to chase Sri Lanka’s score of 320 in only 40 overs to claim a crucial
            bonus point and stay in contention for the final. Kohli’s unbeaten 133 in 86 balls helped India score the
            required runs in just 36.4 overs, but India eventually failed to qualify as Sri Lanka beat Australia in the
            last qualifying match. <br></p>

        <p>Kohli was appointed vice captain of the ODI team for the 2012 Asia Cup, and, though India failed to reach
            the final, Kohli recorded his highest ODI score of 183 in a successful run chase against Pakistan and ended
            the tournament as the highest run scorer. Kohli was a part of the Indian squad that won the 2013 ICC
            Champions Trophy and was the top scorer with 43 runs in the final against England. <br>

            Upon the retirement of his idol Tendulkar in 2013, Kohli took over the crucial number four batting position
            in Tests and showed he had earned the spot by scoring 119 and 96 across the two innings in a drawn Test
            against South Africa at Johannesburg. In the second match of a 2013 ODI series against Australia, Kohli
            scored a century in just 52 balls, the fastest by an Indian player as of 2023, as India successfully chased
            the target of 360 set by Australia with 39 balls to spare. In the sixth match, he scored a hundred in 61
            balls as India successfully chased 350. <br></p>

        <img src="Images/VK-3.avif" alt="" style="width: 100%;" id="img5">

        <p>Kohli was the highest run scorer at the 2014 T20I World Cup, playing a key role in India’s semifinal win
            over South Africa. He was the top scorer in the final as well, a match that India lost to Sri Lanka. Kohli
            subsequently struggled on India’s multi-format tour of England that year, leading many to question his
            abilities. In the 2015 ODI World Cup, he scored one century against Pakistan but otherwise met with
            difficulty. In the 2016 Asia Cup, his run of scores helped India reach the final and win the title. In the
            2016 T20I World Cup, he was again Player of the Tournament, and he was the top scorer in a successful chase
            against Australia as well as in the semifinal, which India lost to the eventual champion West Indies.</p>

        <p>Finishing a stellar T20I career with a Player of the Match performance - that's just quintessential Virat
            Kohli.

            He ends his international career in the format with the most runs of any player at Men's T20 World Cups -
            1,292 between 2012 and 2024, in 33 innings across 35 matches.

            What's more, he averages 58.72, with a strike-rate of 128.81.

            As he steps back from representing India in T20 internationals, it's a fine time to look back at some of his
            superlative performances in T20 World Cups. </p>
